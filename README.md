# Linear Regression

This project is designed to run a regression on a data set.

## Basic

The basic algorithm is a simple learn and plot algorithm for a Linear Regression.

## Advanced

The advanced method is a step-by-step walk through for returning the Iteration Vs. Cost plot as well as the general
formula for the predictive line of the regression - the result of f(x) = mx + c.
